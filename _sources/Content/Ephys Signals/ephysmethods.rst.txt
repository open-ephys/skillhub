Different Electrophysiology Methods
***********************************

Electrophysiologists measure signals from different sources; different tissues (brain, heart, muscles), different cells (excitatory, inhibitory), sometimes from a single neuron and sometimes from large populations of cells. The table below lists some of the major types of extracellular electrophysiology, including typical signal amplitudes and the appropriate electrode type.
