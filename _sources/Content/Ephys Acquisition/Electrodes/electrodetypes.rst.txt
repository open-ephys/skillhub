Types of Electrodes
***************************************

Wire electrodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most basic electrode for in vivo extracellular recordings is a thin insulated metal wire with an exposed tip. Twisting four such wires gives you a :ref:`tetrode <reftetrodeintro>`. Metals such as platinum, gold, tungsten, iridium, titanium nitride, stainless steel and alloys such as nickel-chrome, platinum-iridium and platinum-tungsten have all been used in neural electrodes.

Silicon probes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Silicon probes contain multiple electrode sites organised onto a shank, fabricated using  A recording line travels from each recording site to the headstage or on-probe amplification. The electrode sites themselves are made of titanium nitride (TiN) microelectrodes in the case of Neuropixels 1.0.
